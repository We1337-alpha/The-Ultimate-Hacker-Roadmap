**RAID 5 (RAID 5 Block-Level Parity)** is a RAID level that provides data redundancy and improved performance. It uses parity information to reconstruct data in case of a drive failure.

**How RAID 5 works:**

- **Data striping:** Data is striped across all drives in the array, similar to RAID 0.
- **Parity information:** Parity information is calculated and stored on one of the drives in the array. This parity information can be used to reconstruct data in case of a drive failure.
- **Data redundancy:** RAID 5 can tolerate the failure of one drive without data loss. If a drive fails, the parity information can be used to reconstruct the lost data.
- **Performance:** RAID 5 offers a good balance of performance and data redundancy. It is generally faster than RAID 1 but slower than RAID 0.

**When to use RAID 5:**

- **Data redundancy and performance:** RAID 5 is suitable for applications that require both data redundancy and reasonable performance.
- **Mid-sized arrays:** RAID 5 is often used in mid-sized arrays with three or more drives.

**In summary, RAID 5 is a RAID level that provides data redundancy and improved performance.** It is a popular choice for many applications due to its balance of performance and data protection.
