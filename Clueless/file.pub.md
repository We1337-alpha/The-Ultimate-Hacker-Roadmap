While the file extension ".pub" itself doesn't directly indicate encryption or key files, there are a few possibilities to consider regarding a potential connection between ".pub" files and key files:

**1. Misinterpretation:**

It's possible there was a misunderstanding. Publisher documents (".pub") are not typically used for storing cryptographic key files. Encryption isn't built-in to Publisher, and key files would be in a different format associated with encryption software.

**2. Third-party encryption:**

There's a chance the ".pub" document might be encrypted with a separate tool. This encryption tool could have its own key file format that isn't directly related to the ".pub" extension.

In this case, the key file wouldn't be stored within the ".pub" document itself. It would be a separate file generated by the encryption tool and needed to decrypt the document.

**3. Custom usage (less likely):**

In very rare cases, someone might have developed a custom system using Publisher files and external key files for their own specific needs. This is unlikely, but technically possible.

**Here's how to determine the situation:**

- **Check the source:** If you received the ".pub" file from someone, ask them directly. They might clarify if the document is encrypted and how to access it.
- **Document properties:** Open the file in Publisher. Go to "File" > "Info" and look for any information about encryption or password protection. If it mentions password protection, that's the only security applied.
- **File size and format:** Encrypted files often have larger file sizes compared to unencrypted ones. You can also check the file properties for details about the format. Encryption might use a different format altogether, not just ".pub".

**Overall,** the connection between ".pub" files and key files is not typical. If you're unsure about the encryption status of a ".pub" document, your best bet is to contact the person who provided it or try opening it in Publisher.
