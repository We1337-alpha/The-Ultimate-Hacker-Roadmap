**RAID 10 (RAID 10 Striped Mirroring)** is a RAID level that combines the features of RAID 1 and RAID 0. It provides both data redundancy and improved performance.

**How RAID 10 works:**

- **Data striping:** Data is striped across multiple drives in a RAID 0 configuration.
- **Data mirroring:** Each stripe is mirrored across another set of drives, creating a RAID 1 configuration.
- **Data redundancy:** RAID 10 can tolerate the failure of one drive per mirrored set without data loss.
- **Performance:** RAID 10 offers high performance, as data can be read from multiple drives simultaneously.

**When to use RAID 10:**

- **High performance and data redundancy:** RAID 10 is suitable for applications that require both high performance and data protection.
- **Large arrays:** RAID 10 is often used in large arrays with four or more drives.

**In summary, RAID 10 is a RAID level that provides high performance and data redundancy.** It is a popular choice for applications that require both speed and data protection.
