**RAID 1 (RAID 1 Mirroring)** is a RAID level that provides data redundancy by creating a mirror image of data across multiple drives. This means that the same data is stored on two or more drives, ensuring that data can be recovered in case of a drive failure.

**How RAID 1 works:**

- **Data mirroring:** Data is mirrored across all drives in the array, meaning that the same data is stored on each drive.
- **Data redundancy:** RAID 1 provides high data redundancy, as data can be recovered from any of the drives in the array in case of a drive failure.
- **Performance:** RAID 1 can slightly degrade performance compared to RAID 0, as data must be written to multiple drives.

**When to use RAID 1:**

- **Data protection:** RAID 1 is ideal for applications where data protection is critical, such as servers, databases, and critical business applications.
- **Small arrays:** RAID 1 is often used in smaller arrays with two or three drives.

**In summary, RAID 1 is a RAID level that provides high data redundancy but may slightly degrade performance.** It is suitable for applications where data protection is a top priority.
