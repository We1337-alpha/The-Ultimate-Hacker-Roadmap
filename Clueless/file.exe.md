**file.exe** is a generic filename extension commonly used for executable files on Windows operating systems. It indicates that the file contains instructions that can be executed by the computer's processor.

The ".exe" extension is derived from the word "executable." When you double-click a file with this extension, the operating system attempts to launch the associated application or program.

**Note:** While ".exe" is the most common extension for executable files on Windows, other extensions like ".com" (for older DOS-based programs) and ".dll" (for Dynamic Link Libraries) can also be used.
