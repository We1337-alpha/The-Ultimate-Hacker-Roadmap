# Complete Beginner - Level 0

**Is this you?:** You're interested in computers and want a job dealing with computer networks, security, servers, etc. In the past, you've managed to log into the BIOS on your computer, install a new Graphics Card on your PC, and maybe you torrented a few movies from Pirate Bay. You're tech savy but are not good enough to get an entry-level position in IT.

# What you should focus on:

These are the skills you'll need to have to _break into the field_. Acquiring the recommended certifications and learning these necessary skills should land you a paying job as an IT Support Specialist. Starting in IT Support is the best way to make connections, gain experience, and pivot into more advanced technical careers such as Security, Administration, or Development.
