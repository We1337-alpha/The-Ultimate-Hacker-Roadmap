**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is a firmware program stored on a chip on your motherboard. It controls the basic operations of your computer hardware when it's first powered on. You can often use BIOS to enable or disable specific devices.

**Here's a general guide on how to access and modify BIOS settings:**

1. **Access BIOS:**
    
    - **During startup:** Look for a prompt on the screen that tells you to press a specific key (e.g., Del, F2, F10) to enter BIOS setup. You'll usually see this prompt briefly during the boot process.
    - **After startup:** Some systems allow you to access BIOS by restarting the computer and pressing the designated key immediately after the power-on self-test (POST) completes.
2. **Navigate to Device Settings:**
    
    - Use the arrow keys, Tab, and Enter to navigate through the BIOS menus.
    - Look for a section related to devices, such as "Peripheral Devices," "Onboard Devices," or "Integrated Peripherals."
3. **Enable or Disable Devices:**
    
    - Locate the specific device you want to enable or disable.
    - Use the arrow keys to select the device and press Enter.
    - Look for an option to "Enable" or "Disable" the device. Toggle the setting as needed.

**Common devices you might find in BIOS settings include:**

- **Onboard network adapters**
- **Onboard sound cards**
- **USB ports**
- **SATA ports**
- **Legacy devices (e.g., floppy drives, parallel ports)**

**Note:** The exact options and terminology in your BIOS may vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. Consult your motherboard's manual for specific instructions.

**Be cautious when making changes in BIOS.** Incorrect settings can prevent your computer from booting or cause hardware malfunctions. If you're unsure about a setting, it's best to leave it as it is.
