**file.css** is a common file extension for **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**, which are used to style HTML elements. CSS allows you to control the appearance of your web page, including font, color, layout, and more.

**How CSS works:**

- **Selectors:** CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements. Common selectors include:
    - Element selectors: Match elements based on their name (e.g., `p`, `h1`).
    - Class selectors: Match elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., `.my-class`).
    - ID selectors: Match elements with a specific ID attribute (e.g., `#my-id`).
- **Properties:** CSS properties define the style of an element. Common properties include:
    - `color`: Sets the text color.
    - `font-size`: Sets the font size.
    - `font-family`: Sets the font family.
    - `background-color`: Sets the background color. Â 
    - `margin`: Sets the outer space around an element.
    - `padding`: Sets the inner space around an element.
- **Values:** Properties are assigned values that specify the desired style.

**Example of a simple CSS file:**

CSS

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  font-size: 36px;
}

p {
  color: #666;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

**To use a CSS file with an HTML document:**

1. **Link the CSS file:** In the `<head>` section of your HTML document, use the `<link>` element to link to the CSS file:
    
    HTML
    
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    ```
    
2. **Apply styles:** Use CSS selectors and properties to style your HTML elements.
    

**By using CSS, you can create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.**
