**UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit)** is a variable-width character encoding standard that can represent most of the world's written languages, including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

**Key characteristics of UTF-8:**

- **Variable-width:** UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes to represent each character, depending on the character's complexity. This allows for efficient encoding of characters from different languages.
- **Backward compatibility:** UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, meaning that ASCII characters are encoded using a single byte, just like in ASCII.
- **Wide range of characters:** UTF-8 can represent over 1 million characters, including characters from almost all writing systems.
- **Efficiency:** UTF-8 is generally more efficient than other Unicode encoding standards, especially for English and other languages that use Latin characters.

**Common uses of UTF-8:**

- **Web development:** UTF-8 is the default character encoding for HTML and other web technologies, making it essential for internationalization and localization.
- **Text processing:** UTF-8 is used for processing text data in various applications, such as word processors, text editors, and search engines.
- **Data storage:** UTF-8 is used to store text data in various file formats, such as XML, JSON, and CSV.

**In summary, UTF-8 is a versatile and efficient character encoding standard that is widely used for representing text data from various languages and scripts.** It is the default character encoding for web development and is essential for internationalization and localization.
