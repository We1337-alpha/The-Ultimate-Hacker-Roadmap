**file.svg** is a file extension commonly used for **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** images. SVG is a vector image format that uses XML (Extensible Markup Language) to describe graphics. Unlike raster image formats (like JPEG or PNG), SVG images are resolution-independent and can be scaled to any size without losing quality.

**Key characteristics of SVG images:**

- **Vector graphics:** SVG images are composed of paths, shapes, and text elements, which are defined mathematically. This makes them scalable and resolution-independent.
- **XML format:** SVG files are XML-based, allowing for complex graphics and animations to be defined using tags and attributes.
- **Interactive elements:** SVG can be used to create interactive elements on web pages, such as buttons, links, and animations.
- **Smaller file sizes:** SVG files can often be smaller than raster images, especially for simple graphics or icons.

**Common uses of SVG images:**

- **Web graphics:** SVG is a popular format for web graphics, as it allows for scalable and high-quality images.
- **Icons:** SVG is often used for icons and other small graphics on websites and applications.
- **Animations:** SVG can be used to create animations and interactive elements on web pages.
- **Technical drawings:** SVG can be used to create technical drawings and diagrams.

**In summary, file.svg is a file extension commonly used for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images, which are vector-based images that can be scaled without losing quality. SVG is a popular format for web graphics, icons, and animations.**
