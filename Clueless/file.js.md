**file.js** is a common file extension for JavaScript files. JavaScript is a popular programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic features to web pages.

**What is a JavaScript file?**

- **Client-side scripting:** JavaScript code is typically executed on the client's computer, in the web browser. This allows for real-time interactions and dynamic content updates without requiring a full page reload.
- **Functions and variables:** JavaScript supports functions, variables, and other programming constructs, allowing for complex logic and data manipulation.
- **DOM manipulation:** JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. This allows you to dynamically modify the content and layout of a webpage.

**Example of a simple JavaScript file:**

JavaScript

```js
function greet(name) {
  alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");
```

This script defines a function named `greet` that takes a name as an argument and displays an alert message. When the script is executed, it calls the `greet` function with the argument "John".

**Common uses of JavaScript:**

- **Web development:** JavaScript is essential for creating interactive web pages, including features like form validation, AJAX requests, and dynamic content updates.
- **Game development:** JavaScript is used to create web-based games and interactive applications.
- **Server-side scripting:** While less common, JavaScript can also be used for server-side scripting with frameworks like Node.js.

**In summary, file.js is a file extension commonly used for JavaScript files, which are used to add interactivity and dynamic features to web pages.** JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications.
