**Integrated Graphics Processing Units (iGPUs)** and **Discrete GPUs** are two types of graphics hardware used in computers. They differ in their design, performance, and capabilities.

### Integrated GPUs

- **Design:** iGPUs are built directly into the CPU chip, sharing its resources and power.
- **Performance:** Generally offer lower performance compared to discrete GPUs, suitable for basic tasks like web browsing and light gaming.
- **Power consumption:** More energy-efficient than discrete GPUs, making them ideal for laptops and compact PCs.
- **Cost:** Often included in the CPU package, making them more affordable than discrete GPUs.

### Discrete GPUs

- **Design:** Discrete GPUs are separate components from the CPU, with their own dedicated memory and processing power.
- **Performance:** Offer significantly higher performance than iGPUs, capable of handling demanding tasks like gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering.
- **Power consumption:** Can be more power-hungry than iGPUs, requiring a more robust power supply.
- **Cost:** Typically more expensive than iGPUs, especially for high-end models.

### When to Choose Which

- **Integrated GPUs:** Suitable for everyday tasks like web browsing, office productivity, and casual gaming on laptops or budget PCs.
- **Discrete GPUs:** Ideal for users who require high-performance graphics, such as gamers, video editors, and 3D artists.

**In summary,** iGPUs are a good option for general-purpose computing, while discrete GPUs are necessary for demanding graphics-intensive tasks. The choice between the two depends on your specific needs and budget.
