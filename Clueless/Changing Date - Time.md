**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is a firmware program that controls the basic operations of your computer hardware. It also stores settings like the system's date and time.

**Here's a general guide on how to change the date and time in BIOS:**

1. **Access BIOS:**
    
    - **During startup:** Look for a prompt on the screen that tells you to press a specific key (e.g., Del, F2, F10) to enter BIOS setup. You'll usually see this prompt briefly during the boot process.
    - **After startup:** Some systems allow you to access BIOS by restarting the computer and pressing the designated key immediately after the power-on self-test (POST) completes.
2. **Navigate to Date and Time Settings:**
    
    - Use the arrow keys, Tab, and Enter to navigate through the BIOS menus.
    - Look for a section related to "Date," "Time," or "System Settings."
3. **Adjust the Date and Time:**
    
    - Use the arrow keys to select the desired date and time settings.
    - Use the arrow keys or other input methods to adjust the values (e.g., year, month, day, hour, minute, second).
    - Press Enter to confirm your changes.

**Note:** The exact options and terminology in your BIOS may vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. Consult your motherboard's manual for specific instructions.

**Be cautious when making changes in BIOS.** Incorrect settings can prevent your computer from booting or cause hardware malfunctions. If you're unsure about a setting, it's best to leave it as it is.
