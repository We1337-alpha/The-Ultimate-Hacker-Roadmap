**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is a firmware program stored on a chip on your motherboard. It controls the basic operations of your computer hardware when it's first powered on. **BIOS firmware upgrades** are updates to this program that can introduce new features, improve performance, fix bugs, or enhance compatibility with new hardware.

**Why upgrade BIOS firmware?**

- **New features:** Upgrades can bring new functionalities to your motherboard, such as support for newer processors or memory technologies.
- **Performance improvements:** Some upgrades can optimize the motherboard's performance, leading to faster boot times or better overall system responsiveness.
- **Bug fixes:** BIOS updates often address known issues or bugs that may be affecting your system's stability.
- **Hardware compatibility:** Upgrades can improve compatibility with new devices or operating systems.

**How to upgrade BIOS firmware:**

1. **Check for updates:** Visit your motherboard manufacturer's website and search for BIOS updates specific to your model.
2. **Download the update:** Download the latest BIOS firmware file to your computer.
