**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique numerical code to each character, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters. Â 

**Key characteristics of ASCII:**

- **7-bit encoding:** ASCII uses 7 bits to represent each character, allowing for 128 possible combinations.
- **Character set:** ASCII includes the Latin alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), numbers 0-9, punctuation marks, and control characters (such as carriage return, line feed, and tab).
- **Extended ASCII:** To represent additional characters, such as accented characters and special symbols, extended ASCII codes were developed. These codes use the eighth bit to represent additional characters.

**Common uses of ASCII:**

- **Text encoding:** ASCII is the most basic character encoding standard and is widely used for text data.
- **Communication protocols:** ASCII is used in many communication protocols, such as teletype and early computer networking.
- **Data storage:** ASCII is used to store text data in various file formats.

**While ASCII is still used in some applications, UTF-8 has become the dominant character encoding standard due to its ability to represent a wider range of characters, including those from different languages and scripts.**
