**Base64** is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in a human-readable ASCII format. It's commonly used to encode binary data, such as images, audio files, or cryptographic keys, so that they can be transmitted or stored in a text-based format.

**How Base64 works:**

1. **Grouping:** The binary data is grouped into 6-bit sequences.
2. **Padding:** If the last group is less than 6 bits, it is padded with zeros.
3. **Conversion:** Each 6-bit sequence is converted to a corresponding 64-character alphabet.
4. **Base64 characters:** The 64-character alphabet used in Base64 encoding typically includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and a few special characters.

**Why use Base64:**

- **Text-based transmission:** Base64 allows binary data to be transmitted or stored in a text-based format, which is often more convenient and compatible with various systems.
- **Email attachments:** Base64 is commonly used to encode binary data in email attachments, as many email clients only support text-based attachments.
- **Data storage:** Base64 can be used to store binary data in text-based formats, such as JSON or XML.

**Example:**

The binary data `01001110 01100101 01110011 01110100` can be encoded in Base64 as `SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh`.

**In summary, Base64 is a useful encoding scheme for representing binary data in a text-based format. It is commonly used for transmitting binary data in email attachments and storing binary data in text-based formats.**
