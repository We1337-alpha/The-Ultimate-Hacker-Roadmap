**RAID 0 (RAID 0 Stripe)** is a RAID level that provides improved performance but offers no data redundancy. This means that if any of the drives in the array fails, all data stored on the array is lost.

**How RAID 0 works:**

- **Data striping:** Data is striped across all drives in the array in blocks. This means that each block of data is split and stored across multiple drives.
- **Improved performance:** RAID 0 can significantly improve read and write performance by distributing the workload across multiple drives.
- **No data redundancy:** RAID 0 offers no data redundancy, meaning that if any drive fails, all data on the array is lost.

**When to use RAID 0:**

- **Performance-critical applications:** RAID 0 is suitable for applications that require high performance, such as video editing, gaming, or database servers.
- **Data that can be easily recreated:** RAID 0 is only suitable for data that can be easily recreated or backed up, as there is no data redundancy.

**In summary, RAID 0 is a RAID level that provides improved performance but offers no data redundancy.** It is suitable for performance-critical applications where data loss is not a major concern.
