**CPU clock speed** is a measure of how quickly a central processing unit (CPU) can execute instructions. It's often expressed in **hertz (Hz)** or **gigahertz (GHz)**. Higher clock speeds generally mean better performance, but other factors like CPU architecture, cache size, and software optimization also play a significant role.

**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is a firmware program that controls the basic operations of your computer hardware. In many cases, it allows you to adjust the CPU's clock speed. This is often referred to as **overclocking**.

**Overclocking** involves increasing the CPU's clock speed beyond its factory-specified rating. This can potentially improve performance, but it also carries risks. Overclocking can generate more heat and stress on the CPU, which can lead to instability or even damage if not done carefully.

**Here's a general guide on how to adjust CPU clock speed in BIOS:**

1. **Access BIOS:**
    
    - **During startup:** Look for a prompt on the screen that tells you to press a specific key (e.g., Del, F2, F10) to enter BIOS setup.
    - **After startup:** Some systems allow you to access BIOS by restarting the computer and pressing the designated key immediately after the power-on self-test (POST) completes.
2. **Navigate to CPU Settings:**
    
    - Use the arrow keys, Tab, and Enter to navigate through the BIOS menus.
    - Look for a section related to "CPU," "Overclocking," or "Performance."
3. **Adjust Clock Speed:**
    
    - Locate the option to adjust the CPU's base clock or multiplier.
    - Increase the value carefully, keeping in mind the risks associated with overclocking.
    - Save the changes and exit BIOS.

**Note:** The specific options and terminology in your BIOS may vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. Consult your motherboard's manual for detailed instructions.

**Before overclocking, it's important to consider the following:**

- **Cooling:** Ensure that your CPU has adequate cooling to handle the increased heat generated by overclocking.
- **Stability:** Test your system thoroughly after overclocking to ensure that it's stable and doesn't crash or exhibit other issues.
- **Warranty:** Overclocking may void your CPU or motherboard warranty.
