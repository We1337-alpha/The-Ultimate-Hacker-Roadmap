**file.cpp** is a common file extension for source code files written in the **C++ programming language**. C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of C, adding features like classes, objects, and templates.

**Key characteristics of C++ code:**

- **Object-oriented programming:** C++ supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Efficiency:** C++ is a relatively efficient language, with compiled C++ code often running faster than interpreted languages.
- **Versatility:** C++ can be used for a wide range of applications, from system programming to game development and scientific computing.
- **Large standard library:** C++ comes with a rich standard library that provides a variety of functions and classes for common programming tasks.

**Example of a simple C++ program:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This program prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

**Common uses of C++:**

- **System programming:** C++ is used to write operating systems, device drivers, and other system-level software.
- **Game development:** C++ is a popular language for game development, especially for performance-critical applications.
- **Scientific computing:** C++ is used for scientific computing and numerical simulations.
- **Web development:** C++ can be used for web development through frameworks like Qt.

**In summary, file.cpp is a file extension commonly used for C++ source code files, which are used to write a wide variety of software applications.** C++ is a powerful and versatile language that offers features like object-oriented programming and a large standard library.
