**CMOS batteries** are small, coin-sized batteries typically found on computer motherboards. Their primary function is to provide power to the **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)** chip, which stores essential system settings like:

- **Date and time**
- **BIOS configuration**
- **Hardware component information**

These settings are crucial for the computer's operation and are retained even when the computer is powered off.

**Why do CMOS batteries need replacing?**

Over time, CMOS batteries can degrade due to age or exposure to extreme temperatures. When a CMOS battery fails, the computer may experience the following issues:

- **Incorrect date and time:** The system may display an incorrect date or time.
- **BIOS settings reset:** The BIOS configuration may revert to default settings, requiring you to reconfigure them.
- **Difficulty booting:** The computer may have trouble starting up or may not boot at all.

**Replacing a CMOS battery** is a relatively simple task that can often be done at home. However, it's essential to follow the correct procedure and handle the battery carefully to avoid damaging your motherboard.
