**file.c** is a common file extension for source code files written in the **C programming language**. C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, operating systems, and embedded systems.

**Key characteristics of C code:**

- **Low-level control:** C provides a high degree of control over the computer's hardware, making it suitable for system programming.
- **Efficiency:** C is a relatively efficient language, with compiled C code often running faster than interpreted languages.
- **Portability:** C code can be compiled and run on a variety of platforms, making it a portable language.
- **Widely used:** C is one of the most widely used programming languages and has influenced many other languages.

**Example of a simple C program:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This program prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

**Common uses of C:**

- **System programming:** C is often used to write operating systems, device drivers, and other system-level software.
- **Embedded systems:** C is a popular language for programming embedded systems, such as microcontrollers and IoT devices.
- **Game development:** C is sometimes used for game development, especially for performance-critical applications.
- **Scientific computing:** C is used for scientific computing and numerical simulations.

**In summary, file.c is a file extension commonly used for C source code files, which are used to write a wide variety of software applications.**
