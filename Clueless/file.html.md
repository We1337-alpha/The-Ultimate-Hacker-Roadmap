**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage. Â 

**How HTML works:**

- **Elements:** HTML uses elements to structure content. Each element is defined by a start tag, end tag, and content.
- **Attributes:** Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
- **Tags:** Tags are used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Common tags include:
    - `<html>`: Defines the root of an HTML document.
    - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the webpage, such as the title and stylesheet.
    - `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage.
    - `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
    - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.: Defines headings.
    - `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink.
    - `<img>`: Defines an image.
    - `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Defines unordered and ordered lists.

**Example of a simple HTML file:**

HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
	</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

**To view an HTML file:**

1. **Save the file:** Save the HTML code as a `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. **Open in a web browser:** Double-click the file to open it in a web browser.

**HTML is the foundation of web development.** By understanding HTML, you can create the structure and content of web pages.
